HTML5 Audio Visualizer
======================

##This An audio spectrum visualizer built with HTML5 Audio API and JavaScript

#How to use:

Download the project to your machine and access the index.html file using your browser
Load an mp3 song of your choice using the file button and watch spectrum-js do the work of pleasing your eyes. Yay!

##Tested on Chrome and Firefox, I doubt this would work for Internet Explorer
